# calculator
An assignment in the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The assignment was to make a simple calculator. I modeled it after the Windows 10 calculator and is rather happy with the result.

I found that the hardest part was not the 'floating point problem', but getting the div that shows the algorithm understandable.
